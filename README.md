### What is the project about?
---
- The project was created as part of communication with Frontend Mentor community. 
- Having started learning front-end development in 2021, I have hardly had to deal with layouts built around floats. Deciding to fix this, I wrote this project to try floats technology. 
- As a result of the completion of the project, I did not know this technology better, but I remain faithful to grids.
